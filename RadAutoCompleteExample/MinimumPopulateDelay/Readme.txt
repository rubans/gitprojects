#MinimumPopulateDelay example#
This example demonstrates how to implement minimum delay before the built-in filtering of the control is triggered. For better user experience a RadBusyIndicator is added in order to give feedback that the delay is triggered and is running.
When deleting the inputted text by pressing the 'Backspace' keyboard key the DropDown of the control is immediately closed and the populating (filtering) is terminated. In those scenarios if a populate (filtering) with the current SearchText should be triggered all that is needed is for the 'Enter' keyboard key to be pressed.
